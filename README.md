### Introduction

This work presents a comparative analysis of postprocessing techniques for multi-model weather ensemble forecasts (Poor Man's Ensemble).

We explore the application of Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) using the IMPROVER framework and also two Distributional
Regression Network (DRN) approaches to postprocess hourly temperature forecasts.
